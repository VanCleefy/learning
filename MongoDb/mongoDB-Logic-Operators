   //this returns acc greater than 6 and exact nr of reviews
   ex: {"accommodates": {"$gt" : 6 }, "number_of_reviews": {"$eq": 50}}
   

   Sintax {"$<operator>" : [{<clause1},{<clause2>},...]}

   $and is used as the default operator when an operator is not specified.

   Explicitly use $and when you need to include the same operator more
   than once in a query. 


db.routes.find({ "$and": [ { "$gt" :[ { "accomodates": 6 }
                                  ] },
                          { "$eq" :[  { "number_of_reviews": 50 } ] }
                         ]}).pretty()

{"$and":[{"accomodates":{"$gt":6}},{"number_of_reviews":{"$eq":50}}]}
